WHY:
The company I work for tracks and executes rental payments through Authorize.net. To update them in our qb database, we do it manually. However this isnt scaleable with growing business, so I coded an autoclicker to do it. This was extremely difficult, not bc of the coding but rather dealing with the qb desktop app. It fails about 5% of the time due to lag spikes. And since it relies on clicking on predetermined spots on the screen, moving around the boxes with the dragging feature means the program must be recalibrated with a seperate program.
