WHY:
The company I work for tracks and executes rental payments through Authorize.net. To update them in our qb database, we do it manually, however this isnt scaleable with growing business. 
So I natually coded an autoclicker to do it. This was extremely difficult, not bc of the coding but rather dealing with the qb desktop app. It fails about 5% of the time due to lag spikes.
